Stretch jQuery Plugin:

Expands text to fill up the entire width of its parent (or at least as much
as possible). It does this in 2 ways. First, it finds the largest font-size
for the text while keeping it on one line. If there is still some space
left to fill, it will increase the gap between the words (word-spacing) to try
and fill it in.

For example, say we wanted to make the following title, "Sprockets and 
Widgets" take up as much of the full 400px of width as possible:

    <h1 style="width: 400px">Sprockets and Widgets</h1>
    <script>
        $("h1").contents().stretch();
     </script>

The actual implementation runs in O(log n) time, where n is the final font size. This makes it more efficient than many existing solutions.

The plugin also takes an optional argument; a map of options. The possible
properties are min, max, and maxSpacing. The min and max properties specify the
min and max font size allowed. If 0, or omitted, then the minimum is 1, and the
maximum is whatever size is necessary. The maxSpacing property can be used to
set the maximum allowable amount of spacing between words (default is as large
as needed).
